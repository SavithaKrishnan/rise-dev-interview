- add intro/description beneath header
- do a test run in build mode
- add error handling for date entry whne it's empty
- add pytest file to check api endpoints
- add info about VPs in the search tab
- add another endpoint-- map of birthplaces ? a visualization of pres ages when they took office ?
- edit ReadMe
    - add instructions to start up app
    - add screenrecording of app working
    - notes about time limit
        - what I did with the 4 hours:
            - adding 2 API endpoints-- search_by_date and visualizations. but visualizations didn't take in any arguments (only calcualted age of presidents at inauguration)
            - building out web app, specifically the 'All Presidents' and 'Search By Date' tabs 
        - what I did with extra time:
            - build out visualizations tab (had some fun with this, haven't had as much experience building out graphs/visualizations wiht React, so was just practicing)
            - parameterize visualizations endpoint to take in different 
    - notes about use of AI
- add notes of what i would change in productionalization/further development:
    - method of authentication (Auth0?)
    - change table to be React Table 
    - make table sortable by different columns
    - standardize date formats
    - in the visualization make some notes about Grover Cleveland and Donald Trump since he served 2 non-consecutive terms
    - maybe combine all threee visualizaitons into one-- something like example ?
    - take steps to protect against sql injection
    - add in pytest file 
    - greater error handling and data validation 
    - add search panel for the 'All Presidents' tab-- allowing users to filter and sort data as they would like
    - additional data sources to create a clear narrative for this app
    - small aesthetic fixes-- make sure George Washington's full name appears in chart, fix tooltip when hovering on bars to remove underscores from Age_At_Inauguration, remove grid lines

- visualizations:
    - age at death over time
    - age at inauguration over time
    - retirement length over time
